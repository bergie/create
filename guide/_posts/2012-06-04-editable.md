The `Midgard.midgardEditable` widget is responsible for loading widgets (for example, the [Hallo](http://hallojs.org) rich text editor) for editing various content elements, and synchronizing those with the underlying [VIE](http://viejs.org) entity instances.

Create.js will load the Editable widget automatically for all RDFa annotated entities on the page, but you can also do it manually:

    jQuery('[about]').midgardEditable({
      vie: new VIE()
    });

## Configuration

* `widgets`: object telling which editor widget to load for which content type
* `collectionWidgets`: object telling which collection handling widget to load for which content type

## Events

* `midgardeditableenable`: when an object has been made editable. Event data contains an object with key `instance` providing the Backbone model instance and `entityElement` providing the element containing the object
* `midgardeditabledisable`: when an object has been made non-editable. Event data contains an object with key `instance` providing the Backbone model instance and `entityElement` providing the element containing the object
* `midgardeditableactivated`: when a particular property of an object has been activated in an editor. Event data contains keys `property`, `instance`, `element` and `entityElement`
* `midgardeditabledeactivated`: when a particular property of an object has been deactivated in an editor. Event data contains keys `property`, `instance`, `element` and `entityElement`
* `midgardeditablechanged`: when a particular property of an object has been changed in an editor. Event data contains keys `property`, `instance`, `element` and `entityElement`
* `midgardeditableenableproperty`: when an particular property of an object has been made editable. Event data contains keys
    * `property` (string),
    * `instance` (object),
    * `entityElement` (array)
    * `element` (array)
    * `editable` (array)

Because of a limitation of jQuery UI, please note that this event can be trigger by the widget only. So, with this HTML structure:

    <article about="/my/article" typeof="sioc:Post">
        <header>
            <h1 property="title">A title</h1>
        </header>
        <div class="content" property="content">
            Some content
        </div>
    </article>

    // this work
    jQuery('body article').bind('midgardeditableenableproperty',
        function(event, data) {
            console.log('i am called')
        }
    );

    // this doesn't work
    jQuery('body article .content').bind('midgardeditableenableproperty',
        function(event, data) {
            console.log('i am called');
        }
    );
